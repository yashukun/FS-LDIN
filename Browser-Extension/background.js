//No BG js needed for this extension
// This extension does not require background scripts as it directly interacts with the popup and content scripts.  
// The popup.js handles the user interface and communication with the server.
// Background scripts are typically used for persistent tasks or event listeners that need to run in the background
// of the browser, but in this case, all necessary functionality is handled within the popup script.
// Therefore, no background.js file is needed for this extension.
